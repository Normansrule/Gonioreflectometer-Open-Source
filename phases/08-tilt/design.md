# 08 · Design

- Yoke (TLT-07a) on the table drum (OG-40, 4 × M2 × 12 self-tap), arms along ±Y so the tilt axis is square to the camera at M3 = 0. Arms carry a 608 each at the tilt axis, 150 mm above the deck = the zero point.
- Cradle (TLT-07c) turns on two **M8 × 35 stub bolts** (TLT-05): head outside → (100T pulley on the +Y arm, 9.4 mm spacer on the other) → 1 mm shim → 608 inner race → 6.8 mm spacer → M8 nut trapped in the cradle. One nut per side clamps the whole stack: nothing to cut, no flats.
- Drive 5 : 1, 280 mm belt. The motor hangs on the inner face of the pulley-side arm, 75.6 mm above the axis, shaft out through the arm (slots = belt tension); everything that turns with the table stays within r ≈ 90 of its axis (pulley and bolt head outside the arm), so the table can turn ±180°.
- The cradle floor holds the pancake spin motor (stage 09); home flag (TBL-07b) on a cradle end block at −90°, endstop on the arm, lead to SKR Pico Z-STOP.
- Checked in CAD: no part of the cradle, platter or spin motor touches the yoke over M2 = −90…90°, and nothing turning with the table touches the table motor, the lazy Susan or the M4 motor over M3 = 0…360°.

Fasteners: M8 × 35 × 2 + nuts, M2 × 12 × 4 (OG-40, self-tap), M2 × 8 × 2 (flag), M2 × 6 + nut (platter hub), M3 × 16 × 4 (tilt motor, through the 12 mm arm) and M3 × 8 × 4 (spin motor face, cradle floor), FRM-07.
